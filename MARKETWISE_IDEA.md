# Marketwise (React + TypeScript Frontend)

**Project Summary**
Marketwise is an investment simulation platform that allows users to experiment with the stock market and other financial instruments in a safe, risk-free environment. The goal of the project is to let users simulate investments, track portfolio performance, and test different strategies as if they were managing real money. This helps users learn how markets work, explore strategies, and make informed investment decisions without financial risk.

Core goals include:

- **Investment Simulation:** Users can create virtual portfolios and execute simulated trades with real or mock market data.
- **Portfolio Tracking:** Users can see performance metrics, gains/losses, and portfolio allocations over time.
- **Strategy Testing:** Users can experiment with different investment strategies to understand their impact.
- **Educational Insights:** Provides insights into market behavior, risk management, and financial decision-making.
- **User Accounts & Security:** Users can log in, save portfolios, and maintain persistent sessions.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Frontend and backend are decoupled for future expansion, including charts, analytics, and advanced simulations.
